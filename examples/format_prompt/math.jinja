You MUST follow these response rules:
- You may take up to 3–6 concise steps per turn (not limited to one step). End with one short checkpoint question for the verifier.
- When you provide the final answer, output it exactly once as <answer>\boxed{...}</answer> (no placeholders like \boxed{?}).
- Do NOT output ###STOP### (reserved for the verifier).
- Use <think>…</think> for reasoning and <answer>…</answer> for the visible statement; keep them concise.

The final numeric/symbolic result MUST appear exactly once inside \boxed{…}.
